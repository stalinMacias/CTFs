# Solution 2 - Create an Attacker contract that will only contains the constructor() and when constructor is executed at deployment time, using assembly, it will return to the EVM for permanent storage the opcodes of the `runtime code` that returns 42
- The `constructor` basically loads to memory the `runtime code` and then returns it to the EVM for permanent storage as the contract's code!

- The `creation code` will be generated by the compiler, but the `runtime code` will be explicitly set in the contract code defined inside the constructor
  - Use assembly to load into memory the `runtime code` and then returns it to the EVM

```
constructor() {
    assembly{
      mstore(0, 0x602a60005260206000f3) // Load the runtime code at memory position 0
      // All the memory words are 32 bytes length, the word 0 where the runtime code will be stored will be zeroe padded on the left (22 zeroes will be added to the left)
      return(0x16, 0x0a)                // Return 10 bytes from memory starting at position 22 (0x16) -> The runtime code was stored starting exactly at the 0x16 byte of the word 0
    }
  }
```
