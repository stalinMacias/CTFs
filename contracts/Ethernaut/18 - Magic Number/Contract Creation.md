# Contract Creation Process
The <b>contract creation process executes</b> the `creation code` and <b>stores to the blockchain</b> the `runtime code`

## Creation Code
- The `creation code` is executed <b>only when the contract is been created</b>
	- The `contract’s constructor` is part of the creation code

## Runtime Code
- The `runtime code` is the code that <b>`will be executed` every time someone or something `interacts with the contract`</b>
